# Hex_Board_Game
 AI trained with the Monte Carlo method
 
The HexBoard game project is an exciting venture that brings the classic board game "Hex" to life with the power of C++ programming. 
Hex is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to create a path from one side of the hexagonal board to the opposite side before your opponent can do the same. 
This project not only showcases the traditional gameplay but also incorporates advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to make it a compelling and challenging experience.

In this project, I have created a digital hexagonal game board, allowing players to engage in thrilling matches with either a human opponent or a highly competitive AI computer player. 
The gameplay experience is enhanced through the application of various algorithms, including disjoint-set data structures for determining the winner and Monte Carlo methods for crafting an intelligent AI opponent.

Key Features:

Hexagonal Game Board: The game board is designed in the shape of a hexagon, providing a unique and visually engaging gaming experience.

Player Choice: At the start of each game, the user is given the opportunity to choose between playing as the Blue or Red player. The computer will serve as the opposing player, initiating the competition.

Gameplay: The core gameplay of Hex revolves around the strategic placement of pieces on the hexagonal cells. Players aim to create a path connecting their sides of the board while blocking their opponent's progress.

Disjoint-Set Algorithm: The project incorporates disjoint-set (union-find) data structures to efficiently determine the winner of each game. 
This algorithm analyzes the connections on the board, allowing the game to declare a victor when a winning path is created.

Monte Carlo AI: The computer opponent utilizes Monte Carlo methods to make intelligent decisions and provide a challenging gaming experience. 
This AI algorithm evaluates potential moves through simulations, ensuring a formidable adversary for the user.

The HexBoard game project represents the intersection of classic board gaming and modern programming techniques. 
It offers an engaging and strategic gameplay experience with the added challenge of competing against a sophisticated AI opponent. 
Whether you're a seasoned Hex player or new to the game, this project provides an exciting platform for hours of competitive fun and strategic thinking. 
Get ready to dive into the world of Hex and experience this classic game like never before.
